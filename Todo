<Czero> if you to a 'todo', one thing to take into account is that I think my
  pseudo dynamic typing doesn't choose methods in the same way as javac would

<Czero> I think in Java_invocation there is some hacky invalid code for
  dealing with teeny types that should probably be clipped out, peeking

take a look at yassl again

read floats with exponential notation
it would be nice if we could write read-macros

exceptions

should Symbol be simply String?
maybe Lists should be Vectors
use Hashtable instead of awklisp get and put
do numbers in terms of the 1.1 number classes

symbol table should be either synchronized or thread-local -- what
else should we do about threads?  we want to spawn 'em in the
language, and stuff, too.

more iteration constructs, or make it tail-recursive

make sure it's easy for java code to call on lisp, as well
